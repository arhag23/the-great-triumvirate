            <h2 class="header-subtitle">brief biography</h2>
            <p class="header-text">Daniel Webster was born January 18, 1782 in New Hampshire. He attended various classes and spent a year in Phillips Exeter Academy before ending up in Dartmouth College. There he excelled at public speaking and read law, eventually going to Boston to study under a prominent lawyer. He then started his own practice, moving to Portsmouth in 1807.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1816, he moved again to Boston, representing the city’s Businessmen in the House of Representatives. He had values of free trade, pushing against the government’s will to regulate commerce.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Initially, he stood by state’s having extreme sovereignty, possibly hinting at nullification of the federal government’s laws. However, by the time of the nullification crisis, he stood a strong nationalist, defending the powers of the federal government.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">After the nullification crisis, he stood poised to become Jackson’s successor after allying with him. However, they disagreed on a vast array of issues, leading to Webster becoming one of the leaders of the new “Whig” party, alongside Henry Clay.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In the 1850s, a new crisis had emerged, and Webster came to the support of Henry Clay’s compromise. He pushed for the compromise, using all of his power to do so. He is most notably remembered for his 7th of March speech where he fiercely advocated the aforementioned proposal.

            <p class="header-text">Daniel Webster is very well known for his 7th of March speech, one calling especially for unity of the burgeoning nation. His speech threw a fervor of nationalism and aimed and helping bring the country together in a time of great partisan disagreement. He pushed for the ratification of Clay's proposal in the hopes that it would be able to subjugate the growing fires of conflict. After his speech, it turned him to an idol of the national spirit, and here are some choice quotes from the speech.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“The East, the North, and the stormy South combine to throw the whole sea into commotion, to toss its billows to the skies, and disclose its profoundest depths.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">In this statement, Webster makes an analogy to the Seas, stating that all the various parts of the US are like winds from different directions blowing at the ship of America, threatening to sink it to the depths of anarchy.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“Every member of every Northern legislature is bound by oath, like every other officer in the country, to support the Constitution of the United States; and the article of the Constitution which says to these States that they shall deliver up fugitives from service is as binding in honor and conscience as any other article.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">In this statement, Webster talks about the Fugitive Slave Act, stating that despite the fact that the North might disagree with it, they have a duty to uphold the law of the land. They must follow through with the compromise because they agreed upon it. He says this in an effort to ease tension because the North must be responsible for their actions as well. He puts back his anti-slavery position to appeal to unity.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“Am I to become a sectional man, a local man, a separatist, with no country in common with the gentlemen who sit around me here, or who fill the other house of Congress? Heaven forbid! Where is the flag of the republic to remain? Where is the eagle still to tower? or ishe to cower, and shrink, and fall to the ground?”</p>
            <p class="header-text">Webster mocks the fact that all the issues have become the North vs the South when they all share a common banner that united them. They all stand under the flag of America, yet they only look for their own interests, the regional interests. He is disappointed in this sense that these politicians no longer look at their fellow countrymen from other parts of the country as allies under the same flag but of great enemies. Webster wants concord not discord among the country.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“No monarchical throne presses these States together, no iron chain of military power encircles them; they live and stand under a government popular in its form, representative in its character, founded upon principles of equality, and so constructed, we hope, as to last for ever. In all its history it has been beneficent; it has trodden down no man's liberty; it has crushed no State.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">Here Webster reminds the people what is so great about America. He reminds us of the pillars this country is built on and exactly what we fought the revolutionary war. He talks about what unites us, the fact that the government is a democratic institution where we have a say. No single person controls the entire government, no military threatens their every action and he hopes that this wonderful country can last to the ends of time because of how great it is.</p>
