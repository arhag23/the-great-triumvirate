            <p class="header-text">Daniel Webster was born January 18, 1782 in New Hampshire. He attended various classes and spent a year in Phillips Exeter Academy before ending up in Dartmouth College. There he excelled at public speaking and read law, eventually going to Boston to study under a prominent lawyer. He then started his own practice, moving to Portsmouth in 1807.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1816, he moved again to Boston, representing the city’s Businessmen in the House of Representatives. He had values of free trade, pushing against the government’s will to regulate commerce.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Initially, he stood by state’s having extreme sovereignty, possibly hinting at nullification of the federal government’s laws. However, by the time of the nullification crisis, he stood a strong nationalist, defending the powers of the federal government.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">After the nullification crisis, he stood poised to become Jackson’s successor after allying with him. However, they disagreed on a vast array of issues, leading to Webster becoming one of the leaders of the new “Whig” party, alongside Henry Clay.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In the 1850s, a new crisis had emerged, and Webster came to the support of Henry Clay’s compromise. He pushed for the compromise, using all of his power to do so. He is most notably remembered for his 7th of March speech where he fiercely advocated the aforementioned proposal.
