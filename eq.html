            <h2 class="header-subtitle">A1 - How do citizens, civic ideals and government institutions interact to balance the needs of individuals and the common good?</h2>
            <p class="eq-answer">Citizens, civic ideals, and government institutions interact to balance the needs of individuals and the common good in the objective of retaining order. All three of the Great Triumvirate attempted to keep the country together. They all wished for the country to remain as one and that is how they balanced the power of the government and the needs of the people to abolish slavery.</p>
            <h2 class="header-subtitle">A2 - How have economic, political and cultural decisions promoted or prevented the growth of personal freedom, individual responsibility, equality and respect for human dignity?</h2>
            <p class="eq-answer">Political and cultural decisions in the birth of this nation have prevented the growth of freedom and equality. The practice of slavery and the continuance of it led to the civil war. The civil war was the bloodiest war of American history. There was no respect for human dignity, especially that of the African Americans.</p>
            <h2 class="header-subtitle">B - How do physical geography, human geography and the human environment interact to influence or determine the development of cultures, societies and nations?</h2>
            <p class="eq-answer">The physical geography of America has led to a division in the country. The North, South, and West have their own sort of independent cultures amongst the entire nation. The sprawling nature of America and the fact that it was to be expanded from one side of the continent to the other led to a great many problems. When it came to introducing new states, each time the discussion of slavery was brought up, further dividing the nation.</p>
            <h2 class="header-subtitle">D1- How do our interpretations of past events inform our understanding of cause and effect and continuity and change and how do they influence our beliefs and decisions about current public policy issues?</h2>
            <p class="eq-answer">Our interpretation of the civil war and all events leading up to it can help us to understand how deep the roots of segregation lie in our country. After seeing the changes after the civil war, we can begin to understand that emancipating the slaves was not a complete solution to a giant problem. These events can help us to decide on how to go about change, especially in light of the current Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
            <h2 class="header-subtitle">D2 - How can the study of multiple perspectives, belief systems and cultures provide a context for understanding and challenging current public actions and decisions in a diverse and interdependent world?</h2>
            <p class="eq-answer">By reading upon speeches and understanding the viewpoints of people from all around the country, we can gain a deeper understanding of where certain beliefs come from for a greater way to counter them. This context can be used in our current diverse world to better understand each other. We can challenge public actions and decisions better if we can understand why they are made.</p>
