            <h2 class="header-subtitle">Brief Biography</h2>
            <p class="header-text">Henry Clay, known as the Great Compromiser, was born in Virginia during the American Revolution. He had a comfortable childhood, living in relative wealth. He studied under the attorney general and former governor Robert Brooke, passing the bar in 1797.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He moved with his family to Kentucky where he established a prosperous law practice. He was known to be an exceptional defense lawyer, pioneering many strategies. Law inevitably led him to politics where he served on the Kentucky legislature and later the Senate.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1811, he won the election for the House of Representatives and became the youngest speaker of the House at the time. In 1824 he had an unsuccessful run for presidency. However, due to his support of John Quincy Adams, he was able to land a spot as his Secretary of State. However, in the next election, Jackson won, leaving Clay to go back to the Senate, which would end up being his home for perpetuity.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Clay headed the anti-Jacksonian forces in the Senate and soon directed a coalition of forces that would later call itself the “Whig” party. This party primarily based itself off of opposing Andrew Jackson, but could not agree on much more than that. After another failed run for presidency, he was set for retirement.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">However, with an onset of Tuberculosis that was sure to lead to his death, he returned to the Senate for which he revealed his radical new plan to eliminate slavery in a great number of areas as well as settle regional discord through compromise.

            <h2 class="header-subtitle">quotes</h2>
            <p class="header-text">Despite Clay’s original ambivalence towards slavery as a means for greater political support, he stood a stauch supporter of the abolitionist movement. We can see throughout his speech on the Missouri Compromise his efforts to quell the disputes of the party in search for a greater unity for the United States as a whole. Below are some important quotes that show his disposition on such matters.</p>
    	    <p class="header-text-quote">“It is impossible for us not to perceive that party spirit and future elevation mix more or less in all our affairs, in all our deliberations. At a moment when the White House itself is in danger of conflagration, instead of all hands uniting to extinguish the flames, we are contending about who shall be its next occupant.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">In this quote, Clay first admits that it is obviously impossible to keep the party lines outside of political decisions. However, he berates the fact that the country is in great turmoil, rather than working together to fix it, the parties are more focused on who will be next to take the seat of president. He reckons that the politicians need to work together rather than create more disputes.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“It seemed to me to be doing very little if we settled out one question and left other distracting questions unadjusted, it seemed to me to be doing little if we stopped one leak only in the ship of the State, and left other leaks capable of producing danger, if not destruction, to the vessel.” </p>
            <p class="header-text">In this tidbit, Clay points out the fact that each of the previous compromises and decisions made about slavery have merely covered a small portion of the issue at hand and deliberately ignored the overarching problems. He implies that if they kept on ignoring the actual issue of slavery they will come to the point where all these small reparations will do nothing to stop the deluge. The ship of the state will sink if they are not to settle all the problems and not just one or two.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“And then, if unfortunately civil war should break out, and we present to the nations of the earth the spectacle of one portion of this Union endeavoring to subvert an institution in violation of the Constitution and the most sacred obligations that can bind men;”</p>
            <p class="header-text">Here, Clay manages to predict the very real fact that Civil War could and would break out. This war would be gruesome and it would be a war about establishing the law of the Constitution on an institution that had been ignored : slavery.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“Now, sir, I think it is a mark of no good neighbor, of no kindness, of no courtesy, that a man living in a slave State cannot now, with any sort of safety, travel in the free States with his servants, although he has no purpose whatever of stopping there longer than a short time.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">Despite Clay's anti-slavery position, he still finds it important to compromise. It is clear that he would like to see slavery gone, but he would rather peace than that. So he offers that in the free states, there still should be protection for the rights of a man from a slave state. He should not be stripped of his servants upon entering a free state, but be allowed free travel. However, he does point out that this does not condone illicit behavior.</p>
