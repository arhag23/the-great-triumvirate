            <h2 class="header-subtitle">Brief Biography</h2>
            <p class="header-text">Henry Clay, known as the Great Compromiser, was born in Virginia during the American Revolution. He had a comfortable childhood, living in relative wealth. He studied under the attorney general and former governor Robert Brooke, passing the bar in 1797.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He moved with his family to Kentucky where he established a prosperous law practice. He was known to be an exceptional defense lawyer, pioneering many strategies. Law inevitably led him to politics where he served on the Kentucky legislature and later the Senate.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1811, he won the election for the House of Representatives and became the youngest speaker of the House at the time. In 1824 he had an unsuccessful run for presidency. However, due to his support of John Quincy Adams, he was able to land a spot as his Secretary of State. However, in the next election, Jackson won, leaving Clay to go back to the Senate, which would end up being his home for perpetuity.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Clay headed the anti-Jacksonian forces in the Senate and soon directed a coalition of forces that would later call itself the “Whig” party. This party primarily based itself off of opposing Andrew Jackson, but could not agree on much more than that. After another failed run for presidency, he was set for retirement.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">However, with an onset of Tuberculosis that was sure to lead to his death, he returned to the Senate for which he revealed his radical new plan to eliminate slavery in a great number of areas as well as settle regional discord through compromise.
