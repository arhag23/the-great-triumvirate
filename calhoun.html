            <h2 class="header-subtitle">brief biography</h2>
            <p class="header-text">John C. Calhoun was born in South Carolina on March 18, 1782. He was a champion of states rights and the South. He started off in a local academy before entering the junior class of Yale College. He then proceeded with a year of law school and then passed the bar exam.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Calhoun was elected to the House in 1811, where alongside Clay, he championed war against Britain. After the war, he was a strong nationalist and earned many accolades for his skills as one of the leaders of the Republican Party.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He ran for president three times, though he never succeeded. However, he served twice as the vice president, once for John Quincy Adams and then for Andrew Jackson. 
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1831, he openly shared his beliefs for nullification. He pushed his ideas that each state had sovereign power of itself and that the states possessed the right of self government. This led to the nullification crisis of 1832. 
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He vehemently supported slavery and in fact his theory of nullification was further driven to support slavery in the South. Calhoun’s beliefs are remarkably strange, that of a nationalist who wished war against Britain, but also believed in state sovereignty.

            <h2 class="header-subtitle">quotes</h2>
            <p class="header-text">Unlike Webster and Clay, Calhoun offers a different perspective, one of the South. One of his most famous and quite interesting works is that of his The Positive Good of Slavery speech. This speech is quite an enigma as Calhoun attempts to prove that slavery is actually a good thing. Below are some of his key arguments in his speech that help us to understand Calhoun and the overall South a lot better. Obviously the people who held slaves did not think of it the same way as the North, lest they would have given up the practice the moment it had even begun. It helps to understand various perspectives to truly understand history as it happened and why it happened.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“The very existence of the rule that requires a question to be put on the reception of petitions, is conclusive to show that there is no such obligation. It has been a standing rule from the commencement of the Government, and clearly shows the sense of those who formed the constitution on this point.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">In this quote, Calhoun first argues against the very proposition that Congress has the power to abolish slavery. He addresses the first amendment specifically, arguing that slavery itself is protected by the first amendment. He says that Congress does not have the power to change any of this specifically under the circumstance that if there is a question on whether Congress can do it then Congress ought not to have the power to do so. Basically, if it is questionable that Congress has such a power, then it does not have such a power.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“To maintain the existing relations between the two races, inhabiting that section of the Union, is indispensable to the peace and happiness of both. It cannot be subverted without drenching the county in blood, and extirpating one or the other of the races. Be it good or bad, it has grown up with our society and institutions, and is so interwoven with them, that to destroy it would be to destroy us as a people.”
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In this phrase, Calhoun is trying to say that to maintain the peace in the two races that live in the South, the slaves and the whites, slavery must not be abolished. He argues that to do so would result in the deaths of many all across the country. To his credit, this is exactly what happened in the civil war, leading to more deaths than any other conflict in American history. He also implies that currently the two races live in "harmony" and to poke at this through abolition would inflame the two sides such that they would destroy one or the other. Slavery has existed for a while and it has been there since before and after America was a country. Calhoun says that slavery is such an important institution to the country that to remove it would be akin to destroying the South.</p>
            <p class="header-text-quote">“I hold then, that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilized society in which one portion of the community did not, in point of fact, live on the labor of the other. Broad and general as is this assertion, it is fully borne out by history.”</p>
            <p class="header-text">His last main point is the fact that no prosperous society has existed where one portion of the society has existed only in servitude of the other. He admits that the statement is quite general, but asserts that it is proven through history. He is referencing various other societies whose wealth only existed through the labor of another people. One subjugated the other and got their wealth off the backs of the other. Due to this, Calhoun is arguing that there is no reason for America to change and to do so will put America at risk. By falling from the mold, America will suffer and could fail without the institution of slavery holding it up.</p>
