            <h2 class="header-subtitle">brief biography</h2>
            <p class="header-text">John C. Calhoun was born in South Carolina on March 18, 1782. He was a champion of states rights and the South. He started off in a local academy before entering the junior class of Yale College. He then proceeded with a year of law school and then passed the bar exam.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">Calhoun was elected to the House in 1811, where alongside Clay, he championed war against Britain. After the war, he was a strong nationalist and earned many accolades for his skills as one of the leaders of the Republican Party.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He ran for president three times, though he never succeeded. However, he served twice as the vice president, once for John Quincy Adams and then for Andrew Jackson. 
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">In 1831, he openly shared his beliefs for nullification. He pushed his ideas that each state had sovereign power of itself and that the states possessed the right of self government. This led to the nullification crisis of 1832. 
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">He vehemently supported slavery and in fact his theory of nullification was further driven to support slavery in the South. Calhounâ€™s beliefs are remarkably strange, that of a nationalist who wished war against Britain, but also believed in state sovereignty.
